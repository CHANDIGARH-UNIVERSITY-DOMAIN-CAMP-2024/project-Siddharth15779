# Satellite Deforestation Detection System

## Overview
The **Satellite Deforestation Detection System** is an innovative application designed to monitor and analyze deforestation patterns using satellite imagery. This system provides real-time insights into deforestation activities, enabling better decision-making for environmental conservation efforts.

## Features
- **Satellite Imagery Analysis**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to process and analyze satellite images for detecting deforestation.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides up-to-date information about forest cover changes.
- **Visualization**: Displays deforestation areas on an interactive map.
- **Historical Data Comparison**: Tracks changes in forest cover over time.
- **Alerts**: Sends notifications for significant deforestation events.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- Node.js 14 or later
- React 17 or later
- Required libraries (listed in `package.json`)
- Access to satellite imagery API (e.g., NASA Earth Data or Google Earth Engine)
- A system with internet access
